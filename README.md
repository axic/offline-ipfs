# offline-ipfs

What?! That makes absolutely no sense!

The goal of this project is to create the bare minimum code required to calculate an IPFS hash of a file, without uploading it.

Assuming that every upload of the exact same file should result in the same hash makes this very useful in situations where
online access increases complexity unneccesarily or is impossible. Example is creating hashes within a compiler.
